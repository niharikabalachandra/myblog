Welcome to my blog! I'm Niharika, a passionate data scientist weaving together data, tech, and creativity. Over seven years, I've led teams in ML, NLP, and beyond, transforming data into actionable insights for user-centric solutions in E-commerce and Ad Tech.

But, let's make this journey about us. Follow along as I navigate the ever-changing and sometimes overwhelming world of AI through applied projects. This space is meant to be sharedâ€”a place to connect and learn together.

Expect bi-monthly posts on every 2nd and 4th Saturday. Without further ado, join me on a journey where data tells stories, and together, we explore the algorithms actively shaping our future. Let's connect and delve into this exciting space!
